# Bike-Share-Case-study
Bike share data study using Neural Network to predict the demand of bike in different seasons. 

Bike sharing systems are new generation of traditional bike rentals where whole process from
membership, rental and return back has become automatic. Through these systems, user is
able to easily rent a bike from a particular position and return back at another position.
Currently, there are about over 500 bike-sharing programs around the world which is
composed of over 500 thousands bicycles. Today, there exists great interest in these systems
due to their important role in traffic, environmental and health issues.

The core data set is related to the two-year historical log
corresponding to years 2011 and 2012 from Capital Bikeshare system, Washington D.C., USA
which is publicly available in http://capitalbikeshare.com/system-data. We aggregated the data
on two hourly and daily basis and then extracted and added the corresponding weather and
seasonal information. Weather information are extracted from http://www.freemeteo.com.
